# Machine_Learning_Heart_Disease_Prediction

This project predicts heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset and an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

Key Details:
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease
Algorithm: SVM with RBF kernel
Techniques: Data normalization, classification

Usage:
1.Load and preprocess data.
2.Train and evaluate the model.
3.Predict heart disease for new patient data.
